This is a code book that describe the the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

###Activity label 
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

###subjects
integer numbers indicating the persion. 
1 -30

###transformation
details can be find in run_analysis.R


* download data set
* unzip and set the working dir to "UCI HAR Dataset"
* read tables from training and test tables and combined with rbind
* filter the column required using grep "mean|sd" to get the index and subset them from original dataset
* rename the column names by removing "()",",""-"
* rename the labels with more descritive names like acc -> Accelerometer, gyro >- Gyroscope
* read subject and activity table and combine them with rbind
* add the new columns (subject and activity) into the dataset with cbind
* group by the dataset with the column subject and activity
* calculate the mean for each colun using summize_each function
* write the dataset into tidy_data.txt
